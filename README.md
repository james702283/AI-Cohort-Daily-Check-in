AI Cohort Daily Check-in & Analysis ToolThis is an interactive web application for daily check-ins within a group, such as an AI cohort or a classroom. It features two distinct views: a user-facing page for submitting check-ins and a private, password-protected admin dashboard for historical analysis and data export.User View (/): Allows users to report their morale and understanding of recent material on a scale of 1 to 10. The system provides unique, personalized feedback and displays a live roster for the current day. The ability to check in is controlled by the instructor.Admin Dashboard (/admin): A secure, multi-tabbed dashboard for instructors. It requires a password ("Instructor") to access.Session Control: Instructors can start and end the check-in availability for all users with prominent buttons on the dashboard.Today's Summary Tab: The default view, showing the current date, a list of individual check-ins for that day (name, time, scores), and the day's aggregate statistics (total check-ins, average morale, average understanding).Interactive Calendar Tab: Presents a full-month calendar view. Days with check-in activity are highlighted and clickable, leading to a detailed breakdown for that specific day. Instructors can easily navigate between months.Student Analysis Tab: Lists every unique student and provides a collapsible, detailed view of their entire check-in history (date, time, and scores). This tab also includes a one-click button to export all historical data to an Excel (.xlsx) file for offline analysis.Key FeaturesSecure Admin Dashboard: A separate /admin URL protected by a login page.Instructor Session Control: Admin users can globally enable or disable the ability for students to check in.Persistent Data Storage: Check-ins, including timestamps, are saved to a local checkins.json file. The session status (open/closed) is saved in status.json.Comprehensive Analytics: The dashboard provides at-a-glance daily summaries, an interactive calendar log, and a detailed per-student breakdown.Export to Excel: All check-in data can be easily exported to an .xlsx file.Highly Personalized Feedback: Utilizes an extensive library of 200 unique responses for users.Modern, Professional UI: A sleek, dark, and translucent "frosted glass" design is used on all pages.Technology StackBackend: Python with Flask frameworkFrontend: HTML, JavaScriptStyling: Tailwind CSS (loaded via CDN)Data Storage: JSONData Handling/Export: Pandas & openpyxlHow to Run This ProjectSave Files:Save the app.py file to a new folder on your computer.Save this README.md file into the same folder.Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:Navigate into the folder you just created (e.g., cd Desktop/my-checkin-app).Create a virtual environment (recommended):python -m venv venv
